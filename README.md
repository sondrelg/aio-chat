# aiochat

This is just a little demo project to try to get more familiar with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/).


## How to run the code

Run the server with `python -m server`

Run the client with `python -m client`
